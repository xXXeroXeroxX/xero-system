# Xero Global Prop Fetcher - DraftKings/FanDuel (Blueprint)
# This is a placeholder for a comprehensive scraper/API wrapper that:
# - Scans all sports
# - Pulls all markets (moneylines, totals, spreads, player props, alt lines, novelty bets)
# - Works for both DraftKings and FanDuel
# - Routes to a sniper-grade optimizer

# TODO:
# 1. Scrape or API parse full list of events from DraftKings/FanDuel homepage
# 2. Extract market URLs or identifiers per event
# 3. Loop over every available market, capture:
#    - Sport
#    - League
#    - Teams
#    - Market type (moneyline, alt spread, over/under, player prop)
#    - Odds
#    - Contextual data (e.g., team/player info)
# 4. Normalize data structure
# 5. Run Jarvis Protocol (stat check, matchup, simulation, verdict)
# 6. Group props into stackable, flip-safe parlay recommendations

# ENDPOINT IDEA:
# /xero/all-props-flip-scan
# â†’ Returns: Cleaned, flip-worthy props across both books

# Example data model:
# {
#   "sport": "basketball_nba",
#   "event": "Lakers vs Celtics",
#   "market": "player_points",
#   "prop": "LeBron James UNDER 27.5",
#   "odds": -120,
#   "source": "DraftKings"
# }
